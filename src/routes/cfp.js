					We invite high-quality submissions describing original and unpublished work for the conference. At least one
					author should register for the conference. Though the theme of this conference is Computational Intelligence
					in Data Science and Knowledge Management we also solicit papers from cutting edge technologies like IoT, Cyber
					Security and Software Defined Networks. Machine learning deliver insights hidden in data for rapid, automated
					responses and improved decision making. Machine learning for IoT can be used to project future trends, detect
					anomalies, and augment intelligence by ingesting image, video and audio. Edge computing allows the deployment
					of light weight devices to process data collected from IoT sensors. Machine learning aids cyber security
					systems to analyze patterns and helps to adapt the dynamic behavior to defend against attacks. Modern
					networking paradigms like Software Defined Networking allows high degree of programmability by decoupling
					control plane from the data plane. Cyber security can be measured under 5 themes - firewalls, secure
					configuration, user access control, malware protection and patch management. Accepted papers that are
					presented at the conference will be published in the Scopus Indexed Springer IFIP AICT (Advances in
					Information and Communication Technology) series. Each paper will receive at least three reviews. At least one
					author of each accepted paper must register by the early registration date indicated on the conference website
					and present the paper.
